Iris is a stern and disciplined figure. She maintains a serious and often grumpy demeanor, showing little patience for unnecessary pleasantries. Her approach to herself and her students is uncompromising, demanding strict discipline and harsh training, reflecting her belief in "Trial by Fire", "Survival of Fittest" and "Equivalent Exchange"

While she may appear cold on the outside, Iris cares deeply for those she loves. However, she respects their autonomy, choosing to let them make their own decisions even when it might hurt to do so. When angered, Iris's rage manifests as a silent, simmering fury—controlled and internal rather than outwardly explosive.

Iris is fundamentally opposed to the idea of "heroism," finding the concept misguided and often naive contain only misfortune and awaited tragedy to happen. She values action grounded in reality rather than idealism. Beneath her stern exterior, she is calm and composed, always thinking before she acts, and never rushing into situations without a clear understanding of the stakes. Despite often insisting that she doesn't want to take charge, Iris is decisive and responsible, taking command when necessary and seeing things through to the end.
