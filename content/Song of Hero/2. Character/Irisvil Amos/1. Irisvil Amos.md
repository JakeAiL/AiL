# *Appearance*

Iris is tall and muscular, with warm brown skin marked by scars across her right arm and torso. She has red hair tie into a braid behind her with bang partially covers her right eye. Her eyes are in a light shade of violet, sparkling as if they are luminating crystal. She have a curved black horns on the left side of her forehead along with black sclera eyes and pointed ears, common trait of the demon race. She also have small scar on the left side of her face

She wears a dark, sleeveless top with a one-shoulder garment with long sleeve draped over her left side, adorned with golden patterns. A large belt to secures a skirt-like piece, all decorated with red scales and fur. Her legs are covered by fitted, dark pants, and she wears open-toed sock-like footwear with exposed toes.

# *Personality*

Iris is a stern and disciplined figure. She maintains a serious and often grumpy demeanor, showing little patience for unnecessary pleasantries. Her approach to herself and her students is uncompromising, demanding strict discipline and harsh training, reflecting her belief in "Trial by Fire", "Survival of Fittest" and "Equivalent Exchange"

While she may appear cold on the outside, Iris cares deeply for those she loves. However, she respects their autonomy, choosing to let them make their own decisions even when it might hurt to do so. When angered, Iris's rage manifests as a silent, simmering fury—controlled and internal rather than outwardly explosive.

Iris is fundamentally opposed to the idea of "heroism," finding the concept misguided and often naive contain only misfortune and awaited tragedy to happen. She values action grounded in reality rather than idealism. Beneath her stern exterior, she is calm and composed, always thinking before she acts, and never rushing into situations without a clear understanding of the stakes. Despite often insisting that she doesn't want to take charge, Iris is decisive and responsible, taking command when necessary and seeing things through to the end.

- The name Irisvil mean God Eye, as "vil" are an ancient word refer to deity and divine. Violet as an eyes color is extremely rare for a demon with the only example in history with such eyes color was the first Demon God, the mother of all demon, the All Mother.

- Although when she ascend, all scar and injuries was gone as the ascension rebuild her body but Iris with complete mastery over her body, recreate 3 scars: one on the face left side then one each on right side of her torso and shoulder. Each scar hold a deep meaning so she keep it as memento. When she change into her battle god form, it revert her body back to a perfect state, she have to recreate the scars every time after it
